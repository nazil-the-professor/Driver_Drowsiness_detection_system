# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Introduction

This project is a driver drowsiness detection system that aims to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. 
It detects drowsiness in real-time by analyzing the driver's facial features and behavior using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Real-time detection of driver drowsiness
- Alerts the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected
- Easy to integrate with existing dashcam systems
- Adjustable sensitivity levels for different driving conditions
- Minimal setup required

## How it Works

The system works by analyzing the driver's facial features such as eye movement, blink rate, and head position using a webcam. 
It uses a combination of machine learning, deep lerning algorithms and computer vision techniques to detect drowsiness in real-time.

When signs of drowsiness are detected, such as heavy eyelids or prolonged eye closure, the system triggers an alert to notify the driver. 
The alert can be in the form of an audible alarm, visual warning, or haptic feedback, depending on the preferences of the user.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pygame (for audio alerts)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-drowsiness-detection.git
